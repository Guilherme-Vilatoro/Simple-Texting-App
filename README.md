# Simple-Texting-App
This is a simple website, where 2 people may text to each other.
To use it you must login with one of the users Name displayed at the top, and then insert the password (123456).
Anyone can see the message that you type in, and to get an answer back, all you have to do is to put the name of a User that you would like to talk to.

The message is uploaded to the database when ever there is a change on the input, using AJAX.
The answer is retrieved every 5 seconds, also using AJAX.
